i want to clim the trew and eat some chikken. the yree was thubm tall so it was dificult to climb. 
the bronw foxx jupmed ofer the fence adn lansed on top of the whtie box. it saw a buttetfly and stoppped to look at it. The fox stared curously in amazzement as the cresture lended on its nosse.
the foxrsn awqy scaredd of the insct. 
it skiddaddled into the barn with the pgis. the pigs oinkde in surprise as the fox ran thorugh thier mud puddel.
